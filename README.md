# CS210 Project 3


For this project, we are asked to create a program that would ask the user to select from a menu.
Option 1: Search for a grocery item (ex. Potatoes, Onions, etc.)
Option 2: List all unique grocery items from the file and give the count on how many times they were listed.
Option 3: Similar to Option 2 but instead of a numerical count, you display a histogram by displaying a character multipled by the count.
Option 4: Exit the program.

Solution:

I created 3 cpp files and 2 header files.
   1. Main.cpp
      - Used to call all functions from PrintDisplay.cpp and Menu.cpp
   2. PrintDisplay.cpp
      - contains functions for output display.
   3. Menu.cpp
      - Contains the Item class and the menu option functions.


Descriptions and explanations are inside the cpp files to better understand the approach that I used in creating the program.

Features that were used:
1. Class
   - Mutators
   - Accessors
2. Functions
3. File Stream
4. iostream and fstream
5. iomanip
6. vectors
